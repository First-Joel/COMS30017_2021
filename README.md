# Computational Neuroscience

This is a 3rd year Computer Science and MSc unit. We will try to understand how the brain works from a computational point of view.

## Staff
- [Laurence Aitchison](http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~laurence/) (unit director)

## Important info
All live sessions will be hosted on Microsoft Teams. You should already have been added to the group "COMS30017: Computational Neuroscience (Teaching Unit) 2021/22 (TB-1, A)" You can download the MS Teams app free [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams/download-app), using your UoB email address.

## Links
- [Unit forum subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/coms30017_20_21): ask questions here. It includes questions from the previous year of the course, so some of the "admin" things may be different.  But the course content will be similar!

## Overall structure
- **Weeks 1-7**: Video lectures for the week released each Monday. Please watch when you can during the week. Each week will cover a different topic.  Most weeks will also come with question sheets.
- **Weeks 2-8**: Monday 12-1pm, live Q+A session with lecturer(s). Chance to ask questions to the lecturer about the previous week's material. Hosted on Microsoft Teams.
- **Weeks 2-7**: Wednesday 11-12am, live bubble discussion seminars. Each bubble will be moderated by a TA or lecturer with discussion topics related to the lecture material. Hosted on Microsoft Teams.
- **Weeks 8-10**: Coursework time, for those taking the 20-credit coursework version of the unit ([COMS30015](https://www.bris.ac.uk/unit-programme-catalogue/UnitDetails.jsa?unitCode=COMS30015)).
- **Week 11**: Consolidation week. Catch up week for any further lecture material.
- **Week 12**: Revision week. Preparation week for those students taking the 10-credit written exam version of unit ([COMS30016](https://www.bris.ac.uk/unit-programme-catalogue/UnitDetails.jsa?unitCode=COMS30016) or COMSM0039).
